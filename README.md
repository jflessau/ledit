Telegram bot for fair task assignment.

("ledit" = **le**t's **d**o **i**t **t**ogether)

## Features

Add todos to todo-lists within telegram chats. Each todo is assigned to a random chat member.

Your roommates adds a tedious todo? He may end up assigned to it himself. But the same thing could happen to you.
This makes assignments fair.

You can also create recurring todos, like cleaning all mirrors every 20 days. Once done, recurring todos will be re-assigned to a random chat member.

Overdue todos are marked with a ‚è≥-emoji (see the screenshots below).
